      <p>You join a band and work hard at learning 30-45 minutes worth of music.</p>
      <p>Now you're a real musician! You can perform your music in front of a growing audience of tens of people!</p>

      <p>You've been buying thousands of dollars worth of gear for years. You have multiple basses.</p>
      <p>You have spent more on your rig than your car.  Now load all that gear up into the car, drive an hour, setup for an hour and then sit back for several hours until it's time to perform!  Then play your 30-45 minute set, break everything down, pack it up and drive an hour home.  You just made $100!</p>
      <p><b>You're a real professional!</b></p>

      <p>You've played for decades.  You are known by a handful of people in the industry.  You have played so many gigs you don't even remember the last one.  You realize that your friends who got boring jobs have time for families and money for homes and vacations.  You have free drink tickets, but only for well items.  Your stripper girlfriend kicked you out because you forgot to pick her nephew up from day care again.  You wish you had studied harder in school.</p>

      <p>You know more about writing, recording and performing than ever before, but now you're old, so nobody wants you in their band.  You putter around your small apartment playing random licks on one of the many instruments that decorate your space.  No one visits much anymore.  No one hears the music.</p>
